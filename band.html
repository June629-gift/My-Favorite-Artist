    <li>Here is a short blurb about him.<br><i>Claude Monet</i>, a renowned French painter, was one of the leading figures and founders of Impressionism, often celebrated as the "leader of the Impressionist movement." He was famous for his in-depth study of light and color and his innovative techniques, which fundamentally transformed traditional approaches to shadows and outlines in painting. Emphasizing the capture of fleeting visual impressions under natural lighting, his representative work Impression, Sunrise not only gave the Impressionist movement its name but also marked a significant turning point in modern art. In his later years, Monet’s Water Lilies series came to be regarded as a pinnacle in art history, leaving a profound and lasting influence.</li>
